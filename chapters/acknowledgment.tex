\chapter*{Acknowledgment}

I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Otmar Hilliges for supervising this project. Thanks to him I had the opportunity to get to know many fields in computer science that were unfamiliar to me half a year ago. The last semester was a very challenging and rewarding one. His profound knowledge in many areas was very helpful to me.

Furthermore i would like to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to Christine Ryer-Bringold, my former music teacher. She supported me generously with many hours of supportive advices and conversations about education and music. 

Someone else who deserves my deep gratitude is my mother. The innumerable sacrifices she made to support me whenever she could are highly appreciated and I cannot say how thankful I am for everything she did.
