\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

This work was able to design a training algorithm that was capable of dynamically picking transformers with varying precision and performance capabilities. The algorithm was able to learn a decision strategy that is capable of outperforming other such strategies in both precision and performance. 

In this work, we build a framework for the training and testing of deep Q-networks. With this framework, we are able to devise several different training algorithms, which we can then train, test and find an optimal combination.
