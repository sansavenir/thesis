\chapter*{Abstract}
We use deep Q-networks to increase the performance of numerical analysis whilst maintaining a sufficient precision. In this work, we build upon an existing framework that uses linear basis function approximation in order to model a decision policy for leveraging precision loss for performance gain inside of polyhedra analysis. We expand this framework with the use of nonlinear deep Q-networks for the Q-function approximation. We then further optimise this method by testing new features, reward functions as well as other problem specific optimisations. We also try to increase the flexibility of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we train and test our resulting algorithm, with which we are able to achieve a considerable gain in both performance and precision.
