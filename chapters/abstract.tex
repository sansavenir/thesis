\chapter*{Abstract}
We use deep Q-networks to speed up numerical analysis. The key is reusing an existing link between program analysis and reinforcement learning. Expanding on these methods by testing and modifying the existing features and reward functions. Training with these new algorithms and learning a new and more optimal decision policy.
