\chapter*{Abstract}
We use deep Q-networks to increase the performance of numerical analysis whilst retaining a good precision. In this work, we reuse an existing framework using reinforcement learning to leverage the precision loss for performance gain inside of polyhedra analysis. We expand this framework with the use of nonlinear Q-function approximations. We then further expand this method, by testing new features, reward functions as well as other problem specific optimisations, we also try to increase the flexibility of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we train and test our resulting algorithm. With our final algorithm, we are able of achieving a considerable gain in both performance and precision.
